The traditional, lecturestyle teaching approach can easily fail to address the varied learning styles of students or to promote deep learning of assembly-language programming concepts. This paper describes the Pong mid-term project that has been successfully used to overcome these problems. The Pong project, modeled after the original video arcade game, is an engaging programming project that augments the lecture-style approach while also promoting the deep learning of assembly-language programming concepts and encouraging the students to become independent learners. This paper provides a detailed description of the Pong assignment including the hardware and software requirements, functional description, suggested implementation steps, and the grading structure. Additionally, the overall structure of the introductory assembly-language programming course is discussed and its placement in the electrical engineering curriculum is explained. Assessment data are also presented that demonstrate the effectiveness of the Pong assignment for improving both the depth and level of learning as well as for fostering the development of independent learners. The paper also identifies several limitations of the Pong assignment and discusses how the assignment can be extended to introduce and/or demonstrate higher-level system design concepts.",""

Recently, the advent of pre-trained paradigm enlightens researchers to develop general-purpose pre-trained models which can be applied for a broad range of program understanding and generation tasks. Such pre-trained models, derived by self-supervised objectives on large unlabelled corpora, can be fine-tuned in downstream tasks (such as code search and code generation) with minimal adaptations. Although these pre-trained models claim superiority over the prior techniques, they seldom follow equivalent evaluation protocols, e.g., they are hardly evaluated on the identical benchmarks, tasks, or settings. Consequently, there is a pressing need for a comprehensive study of the pre-trained models on their effectiveness, versatility as well as the limitations to provide implications and guidance for the future development in this area. To this end, we first perform an extensive study of eight open-access pre-trained models over a large benchmark on seven representative code tasks to assess their reproducibility. We further compare the pre-trained models and domain-specific state-of-the-art techniques for validating pre-trained effectiveness. At last, we investigate the robustness of the pre-trained models by inspecting their performance variations under adversarial attacks. Through the study, we find that while we can in general replicate the original performance of the pre-trained models on their evaluated tasks and adopted benchmarks, subtle performance fluctuations can refute the findings in their original papers. Moreover, none of the existing pre-trained models can dominate over all other models. We also find that the pre-trained models can significantly outperform non-pre-trained state-of-the-art techniques in program understanding tasks. Furthermore, we perform the first study for natural language-programming language pre-trained model robustness via adversarial attacks and find that a simple random attack approach can easily fool the state-of-the-art pre-trained models and thus incur security issues. At last, we also provide multiple practical guidelines for advancing future research on pre-trained models for program understanding and generation.  © 2022 ACM.",""

Fake content is spread to popularize unauthorized treatments or downgrade the efficacy of preventative measures and treatments, resulting in spread of anxiety, depression and chaos amongst society. It is need of the hour, therefore, to apply the technologies like deep learning, natural language programming, and data mining, to develop automated systems that can discern false information from the real information, characterize it for better understanding, and mine it to derive actionable knowledge, that helps to check the spread of misinformation. This work proposes an automated framework that uses a combination of NLP & descriptive and predictive machine learning techniques. COVID-19 related messages on the social media sites are classified as appropriate or misleading using a deep learning model. With an accuracy of 86% BERT classifier was used to classify 3777 tweets. The model tagged 2350 tweets as real and 1427 tweets as fake. The classified social media information is characterized based on its sentimental valence, sentimental intensity and emotional acceptance in public, for better understanding. It was found by the framework that the polarity and intensity of negative fake tweets is much higher than the intensity of positive real tweets. It was found by the framework that the sentiment polarity and intensity of negative fake tweets is much higher than the intensity of positive real tweets. The emotional analysis re-enforced that the fear and negativity of the fake tweets far surpass the fear and negativity spread by real tweets. In fact, conclusions could be drawn that established that the real tweets generated more positivity, joy, trust, and lead to more anticipation. Critical information is retrieved from the authentic information, analyzed for better comprehension, and put in an actionable form, ready to be leveraged. The popular fake information, such as myths or rumors, also equally important to be identified are retrieved and understood, in order to develop counter-strategies for curbing their spread. Results demonstrate that the framework developed in this paper is able to successfully classify information as fake or real; sentimentally and emotionally characterize it, and churn out novel, actionable and interesting knowledge, crucial for the policymakers, to curb the spread of misinformation. © 2023 University of Bahrain.

Current code comment generation techniques can be classified into categories: extractive methods and abstractive methods. Extractive methods use text retrieval techniques to extract important code tokens to constitute comments. Such comments contain important factual details articulated explicitly in code tokens, but are poor in naturalness. Abstractive methods usually regard code comment generation as a neural machine translation task. By leveraging powerful deep learning-based language models, abstractive methods can generate comments that resemble human writing. However, compared with natural language, programming language code is more complex. Comments generated by abstractive methods often leave out important factual details. In this paper, we propose a novel method for code comment generation by integrating extractive and abstractive models. Our extractive model is built on the Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) model, effectively extracting important factual details in code snippets. Meanwhile, our abstractive model is built on a deep learning-based encoder-decoder model, enabling it to generate concise and human-written-like comments. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method, called ICS, by conducting extensive experiments on the CodeSearchNet dataset involving six programming languages. The results demonstrate that ICS outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in three widely used metrics: BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE-L. Moreover, the outcomes of the human evaluation indicate that the comments generated by ICS exhibit superior naturalness and informativeness, and closely align with the provided code snippets.  © 2023 IEEE.",""

Pharmacovigilance experts need not be AI experts, but they should know enough about AI to explore the possibilities of collaboration with those who are. Modern concepts of AI date from Alan Turing’s work, especially his paper on “the imitation game”, in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Its scope today includes computational skills, including the formulation of mathematical proofs; visual perception, including facial recognition and virtual reality; decision making by expert systems; aspects of language, such as language processing, speech recognition, creative composition, and translation; and combinations of these, e.g. in self-driving vehicles. Machines can be programmed with the ability to learn, using neural networks that mimic cognitive actions of the human brain, leading to deep structural learning. Limitations of AI include difficulties with language, arising from the need to understand context and interpret ambiguities, which particularly affect translation, and inadequacies of databases, requiring careful preparation and curation. New techniques may cause unforeseen difficulties via unexpected malfunctioning. Relevant terms and concepts include different types of machine learning, neural networks, natural language programming, ontologies, and expert systems. Adoption of the tools of AI in pharmacovigilance has been slow. Machine learning, in conjunction with natural language processing and data mining, to study adverse drug reactions in databases such as those found in electronic health records, claims databases, and social media, has the potential to enhance the characterization of known adverse effects and reactions and detect new signals. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",""

Conventional methods that depend on some predefined domain-specific rules suffer from the lack of robustness and generality. Recent efforts on adopting deep learning to map queries to code requires a large number of labeled examples, making them not applicable on domains with scarce labeled examples. Although a third alternative, natural language understanding (NLU)-driven approach addresses the problems, the long response time hinders its adoption in practice, especially in an interactive scenario. This paper presents a solution to enable near real-Time NLU-driven NL programming. The solution features a new algorithm, dynamic grammar graphbased translation (DGGT), for identifying the best grammar tree for a query via dynamic programming. It also introduces two new optimizations, grammar-based pruning and orphan node relocation, to further reduce the search space and address the special complexities from queries. Evaluations on two domains, text editing and program source code analysis, show that the DGGT algorithm and the optimizations shortens the response time of a state-of-The-Art NLU-driven synthesizer by up to 1887× (25-133× on average) while improving the accuracy by 2-12%.  © 2022 IEEE.",""

A self-attention based Transformer model belonging to the family of deep learning models has been utilized for multi-variate solar time-series forecasting. Using the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) benchmark datasets of two different sites, we demonstrate that the proposed approach exhibit enhanced performance in comparison to RNN models in terms of RMSE, MAE, MBE, and Forecast skill at each forecasted interval.  © 2010-2012 IEEE.",""

They need to memorize big complex syntaxes for all the major tasks in the data science life cycle. Often these tasks are redundant. Therefore, we propose to build an intelligent system that enables data scientists to perform all the tedious and time-consuming tasks such as EDA, data cleansing, data preprocessing, data visualization, modeling, and data science lifecycle evaluation. Just state the logic of your query in natural language the system will automatically output all relevant Python code snippets. Existing applications involving the text-to-code generation and code search are limited and a lot of them do not work in non-ideal conditions. The reason behind it is the data set on which the existing models have been built. These datasets do not consider real-world factors such as slang, acronyms, and paraphrases. Therefore, a new dataset was created consisting of real-world user queries, representing the scenarios a user is most likely to face daily. We plan to build a logic-oriented system that only needs to convey the logic correctly in text in natural language. It saves a lot of time, allowing data scientists to spend most of their time building logic instead of focusing on code. © 2023 IEEE.",""

Statistical language models, which are initially designed for natural languages, have been generally used for modeling programming languages. However, different from natural languages, programming languages contain explicit and hierarchical structure that is hard to learn by traditional statistical language models. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Stack-Augmented LSTM neural network for programming language modeling. Adding a stack memory component into the LSTM network enables our model to capture the hierarchical information of programs through the PUSH and POP operations, which further allows our model capturing the long-term dependency in the programs. We evaluate the proposed model on three program analysis tasks, i.e., code completion, program classification, and code summarization. Evaluation results show that our proposed model outperforms baseline models in all the three tasks, indicating that by capturing the structural information of programs with a stack, our proposed model can represent programs more precisely. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","All Open Access; Green Open Access"

First, in a similar fashion to the famous BERT(Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) algorithm in NLP(Natural Language Programming), a pre-trained transformer-based encoder is utilized to provide an alternative representation of time-series data, replacing conventional data-preprocessing. For a more direct perception of differences in normal and abnormal data, a multi-head attention score is also considered as an input of a two-dimensional convolutional neural network classifier along with the output of transformer encoder. The training of the proposed framework is comprised of two steps: unsupervised pre-training of the transformer encoder with all generated MC simulation data and supervised training of the classifier with labelled data. To generate the MC simulation data, the high-fidelity missile 6DOF simulation program is developed with random variables that represent the uncertainties of realistic scenarios. The resulting anomaly detection performance from the generated MC simulation dataset indicates that the proposed framework provides significantly better detection performance than other supervised machine/deep learning-based algorithms. Furthermore, using a multi-head attention score from the transformer encoder as an input of the classifier not only improves the detection performance but also contributes to reducing the necessity of labelled train data. Hence, the proposed method has the potential to greatly reduce the human effort in detecting anomalies in MC simulation data. © ICROS 2022.",""

In contrast to natural languages, programming languages usually have a well-defined structure. With this structure compilers can reason about programs, using graphs such as abstract syntax trees (ASTs) or control-data flow graphs (CDFGs). In this paper, we argue that we should use these graph structures instead of sequences for learning compiler optimization tasks. To this end, we use graph neural networks (GNNs) for learning predictive compiler tasks on two representations based on ASTs and CDFGs. Experiments show that this improves upon the state-of-the-art in the task of heterogeneous OpenCL mapping, while providing orders of magnitude faster inference times, crucial for compiler optimizations. When testing on benchmark suites not included for training, our AST-based model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art by over 12 percentage points in terms of accuracy. It is the only one to perform clearly better than a random mapping.

This work undergoes major stages like pre-processing, optimal feature selection and DL based feature extraction and classification. In the pre-processing stage, the data imputation process is carried out. Then, the features essential for ASPD prediction are performed using the adaptive Marine Predators optimizer (AMPO). Finally, the selected features are predicted using the multi-head attention based autoencoder (MHA-AE). This classifier is used for predicting whether the individual is affected by the ASPD or not.

Nevertheless, this DL model is attacked by membership inference attacks, model inversion attacks, reconstruction attacks, model extraction attacks, gradient leakage attacks, correlation attacks, and white box attacks (inference attacks). In order to mitigate this issue, various existing research has attempted to design an effective privacy mechanism. However, the existing schemes failed to obtain higher security in DL because of several limitations like computational complexity, lower efficiency, difficult-to-select parameters, cumulative privacy loss, etc. Recently, the auto-encoder-based deep learning model has become more popular due to its great ability, and its variants have achieved notable success in various fields such as medicine, healthcare and NLP (Natural Language Programming). However, the privacy of the auto-encoder model is affected because of the vulnerable attacks. Thus, to avoid this issue, the proposed study prefers the differential privacy (DP) method for securing the deep auto-encoder model. DP is a privacy-preserving technique that can be used to protect deep learning models from the aforementioned attacks. In this paper, a Differential Privacy-Improved Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-ISGD) algorithm is proposed to improve the privacy and utility of the Deep Autoencoder method by adding Gaussian noise to the gradients before the clipping process. Thus, the convergence speed and accuracy of the proposed algorithm are enhanced. The experimentation is conducted in the Python platform, and metrics like convergence, accuracy and TPVD (Total Parameters Value Difference) are evaluated to measure the performance of the proposed study. The comparative analysis is performed for the no privacy, privacy with SGD, privacy with batch gradient descent (BGD) and mini-batch gradient descent (MBGD) models.

The comparison analysis showed that the proposed algorithm achieves better accuracy than other privacy protection methods. Thus, the significant findings in the proposed work state that the proposed privacy model is suitable for several applications, including medical fields, algorithm development, education and awareness, by affording strong privacy guarantees. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.",""
