These images are typically stored either within the local on-premises servers of healthcare providers or within cloud storage infrastructures. However, this conventional storage approach often incurs high infrastructure costs and results in sluggish information retrieval, ultimately leading to delays in diagnosis and consequential wastage of valuable time for patients. The methodology proposed in this paper offers a pioneering solution to expedite the diagnosis of medical conditions while simultaneously reducing infrastructure costs associated with data storage. Through this study, a high-speed biomedical image processing approach is designed to facilitate rapid prognosis and diagnosis. The proposed framework includes Deep learning QR code technique using an optimized database design aimed at alleviating the burden of intensive on-premises database requirements. The work includes medical dataset from Crawford Image and Data Archive and Duke CIVM for evaluating the proposed work suing different performance metrics, The work has also been compared from the previous research further enhancing the system's efficiency. By providing healthcare providers with high-speed access to medical records, this system enables swift retrieval of comprehensive patient details, thereby improving accuracy in diagnosis and supporting informed decision-making. © The Author(s) 2024.","Database; Decision making; Deep learning; Diagnosis; Medical imaging; QR code","Databases, Factual; Deep Learning; Diagnostic Imaging; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Information Storage and Retrieval; deep learning; diagnostic imaging; factual database; human; image processing; information retrieval; procedures","","","","","Ministry of Education, MOE; DSR; Deanship of Scientific Research, King Saud University; King Abdulaziz University, KAU, (146-865-1440); King Abdulaziz University, KAU","Funding text 1: The author gratefully acknowledge technical and financial support from the Ministry of Education and King Abdulaziz university, DSR, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.; Funding text 2: This project was funded by the Deanship of Scientific Research (DSR), at King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, under Grant No. ( J: 146-865-1440).

Light microscopy can be used to diagnose diseases or characterize e.g. blood cells. Since samples under microscopes exhibit certain symmetries, such as global rotation invariance, equivariant neural networks are presumed to be useful. In this study, a baseline convolutional neural network is constructed in the form of the commonly used VGG16 classifier. Thereafter, it is modified to be equivariant to the p4 symmetry group of rotations of multiples of 90° using group convolutions. This yields a number of benefits on a TEM virus dataset, including higher top validation set accuracy by on average 7.6% and faster convergence during training by on average 23.1% of that of the baseline. Similarly, when training and testing on images of blood cells, the convergence time for the equivariant neural network is 7.9% of that of the baseline. From this it is concluded that augmentation strategies for rotation can be skipped. Furthermore, when modelling the accuracy versus amount of TEM virus training data with a power law, the equivariant network has a slope of − 0.43 compared to − 0.26 of the baseline. Thus the equivariant network learns faster than the baseline when more training data is added. This study extends previous research on equivariant neural networks applied to images which exhibit symmetries to isometric transformations. © The Author(s) 2024.","","Algorithms; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Microscopy, Electron, Transmission; Neural Networks, Computer; Rotation; algorithm; artificial neural network; human; image processing; procedures; rotation; transmission electron microscopy","","","","","WASP; Swedish Research Council, (2022-06725)","Funding text 1: We thank Damian Matuszewski for his input on the TEM virus dataset and the choice of architecture.

Most state-of-the-art models rely mainly on external resources such as linguistic tools and knowledge bases to improve system performance. However, they lack effective mechanisms to obtain semantic clues from label specification and sentence context. Given its success in image classification, label representation learning is a promising approach to enhancing biomedical event trigger detection models by leveraging the rich semantics of pre-defined event type labels. Results: In this paper, we propose the Biomedical Label-based Synergistic representation Learning (BioLSL) model, which effectively utilizes event type labels by learning their correlation with trigger words and enriches the representation contextually. The BioLSL model consists of three modules. Firstly, the Domain-specific Joint Encoding module employs a transformer-based, domain-specific pre-trained architecture to jointly encode input sentences and pre-defined event type labels. Secondly, the Label-based Synergistic Representation Learning module learns the semantic relationships between input texts and event type labels, and generates a Label-Trigger Aware Representation (LTAR) and a Label-Context Aware Representation (LCAR) for enhanced semantic representations. Finally, the Trigger Classification module makes structured predictions, where each label is predicted with respect to its neighbours. We conduct experiments on three benchmark BioNLP datasets, namely MLEE, GE09, and GE11, to evaluate our proposed BioLSL model. Results show that BioLSL has achieved state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the baseline models. Conclusions: The proposed BioLSL model demonstrates good performance for biomedical event trigger detection without using any external resources. This suggests that label representation learning and context-aware enhancement are promising directions for improving the task. The key enhancement is that BioLSL effectively learns to construct semantic linkages between the event mentions and type labels, which provide the latent information of label-trigger and label-context relationships in biomedical texts. Moreover, additional experiments on BioLSL show that it performs exceptionally well with limited training data under the data-scarce scenarios. © The Author(s) 2024.","Biomedical event trigger detection; Representation learning; Semantic relationships; Type label semantics","Algorithms; Data Mining; Machine Learning; Natural Language Processing; Semantics; Domain Knowledge; Encoding (symbols); Image enhancement; Learning systems; Semantics; Biomedical event trigger detection; Biomedical text; Event trigger; Event Types; External resources; Label semantics; Learning models; Representation learning; Semantic relationships; Type label semantic; adult; article; benchmarking; controlled study; feature learning (machine learning); female; human; knowledge base; learning; prediction; semantics; algorithm; data mining; machine learning; natural language processing; procedures; Classification (of information)","","","","","Agency for Science, Technology and Research, A*STAR; A*STAR","This research is supported by the Agency for Science, Technology, and Research (A*STAR), Singapore.","Wang X.D., Leser U., Weber L., Beeds: Large-scale biomedical event extraction using distant supervision and question answering, Proceedings of the 21St Workshop on Biomedical Language Processing, 2022, pp. 298-309; Kim J.-D., Wang Y., Takagi T., Yonezawa A., Overview of genia event task in bionlp shared task, Proceedings of Bionlp Shared Task 2011 Workshop; 2011.

Experimental and theoretical studying the structure of films at the quantitative level has been created and tested. By integrating advanced imaging and statistical analysis, we dissect the dynamics and intricacies of domain structures, including cellular and microcrystalline formations, that significantly influence dehydrated biomolecular film properties. The research process entails preparing amino acid and protein solutions, capturing high-resolution images during dehydration, and implementing advanced digital image processing techniques like Laplacian Pyramid Restoration and Gaussian Differential Scale-Invariance for enhanced image clarity. Analytical approach includes domain segmentation and texture analysis using Haralick features, enabling precise quantification of structural complexities in films formed under various dehydration conditions and protein concentrations. The suggested physical model describes the transition from equilibrium solutions through nonequilibrium processes to complex bubble vaporization, dehydration-induced Dewetting and domain differentiation, thus explained observed spiral formations within protein domains. This model provids a detailed mechanistic understanding of how environmental conditions and molecular dynamics drive the formation of domains, paving the way for developing films with tailored properties for diverse applications. These insights hold significant implications across various fields, including material science, nanotechnology, biomedical applications, environmental monitoring, electronics, and photonics. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Biomolecular films; Dehydration-induced crystallization; Dewetting; Haralick texture features; Protein domain analysis","Amino acids; Image enhancement; Medical applications; Molecular dynamics; Proteins; Statistical methods; Textures; nanofilm; protein; Amino acids and proteins; Bio-molecular; Biomolecular film; De-wetting; Dehydration-induced crystallization; Domain analysis; Haralick texture features; Induced crystallization; Protein domain analyse; Protein domains; Article; imaging; molecular dynamics; physical model; protein domain; statistical analysis; texture analysis; vaporization; Dehydration","","protein, 67254-75-5","","","RSF Social Finance, (21-72-20029); RSF Social Finance","This research was funded by RSF, grant number \u211621-72-20029, https://rscf.ru/project/21-72-20029/","Zhang Z., Et al., Active self-assembly of piezoelectric biomolecular films via synergistic nanoconfinement and in-situ poling, Nat.

Leveraging 3D integration, edge devices can achieve unprecedented miniaturization while simultaneously boosting processing power and minimizing energy consumption. Here, we demonstrate a back-end-of-line compatible optoelectronic synapse with a transfer learning method on health care applications, including electroencephalogram (EEG)-based seizure prediction, electromyography (EMG)-based gesture recognition, and electrocardiogram (ECG)-based arrhythmia detection. With experiments on three biomedical datasets, we observe the classification accuracy improvement for the pretrained model with 2.93% on EEG, 4.90% on ECG, and 7.92% on EMG, respectively. The optical programming property of the device enables an ultra-low power (2.8 × 10−13 J) fine-tuning process and offers solutions for patient-specific issues in edge computing scenarios. Moreover, the device exhibits impressive light-sensitive characteristics that enable a range of light-triggered synaptic functions, making it promising for neuromorphic vision application. To display the benefits of these intricate synaptic properties, a 5 × 5 optoelectronic synapse array is developed, effectively simulating human visual perception and memory functions. The proposed flexible optoelectronic synapse holds immense potential for advancing the fields of neuromorphic physiological signal processing and artificial visual systems in wearable applications.

The transformer model is a type of DNN that was originally used for the natural language processing tasks and has since gained more and more attention for processing various kinds of sequential data, including biological sequences and structured electronic health records. Along with this development, transformer-based models such as BioBERT, MedBERT, and MassGenie have been trained and deployed by researchers to answer various scientific questions originating in the biomedical domain. In this paper, we review the development and application of transformer models for analyzing various biomedical-related datasets such as biomedical textual data, protein sequences, medical structured-longitudinal data, and biomedical images as well as graphs. Also, we look at explainable AI strategies that help to comprehend the predictions of transformer-based models. Finally, we discuss the limitations and challenges of current models, and point out emerging novel research directions. © The Author(s) 2024.","Biomedicine; Deep learning; Life Science; Machine learning; Neural networks; Transformer","Artificial Intelligence; Biomedical Research; Deep Learning; Humans; Natural Language Processing; Neural Networks, Computer; amino acid sequence; artificial intelligence; biomedicine; deep learning; deep neural network; diagnosis; electronic health record; explainable artificial intelligence; human; machine learning; natural language processing; nerve cell network; prediction; review; artificial neural network; deep learning; medical research","","","","","European Union’s Horizon Europe research and innovation programme; HTA; MedTech Europe; EuropaBio; Vaccines Europe; Innovative Health Initiative, IHI, (101112135); Innovative Health Initiative, IHI","Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.

This research proposes a novel method for automatic dysarthria detection (ADD) and automatic dysarthria severity level assessment (ADSLA) by using a variable continuous wavelet transform (CWT) layered convolutional neural network (CNN) model. To determine their efficiency, the proposed model is assessed using two distinct corpora, TORGO and UA-Speech, comprising both dysarthria patients and healthy subject speech signals. The research study explores the effectiveness of CWT-layered CNN models that employ different wavelets such as Amor, Morse, and Bump. The study aims to analyze the models’ performance without the need for feature extraction, which could provide deeper insights into the effectiveness of the models in processing complex data. Also, raw waveform modeling preserves the original signal’s integrity and nuance, making it ideal for applications like speech recognition, signal processing, and image processing. Extensive analysis and experimentation have revealed that the Amor wavelet surpasses the Morse and Bump wavelets in accurately representing signal characteristics. The Amor wavelet outperforms the others in terms of signal reconstruction fidelity, noise suppression capabilities, and feature extraction accuracy. The proposed CWT-layered CNN model emphasizes the importance of selecting the appropriate wavelet for signal-processing tasks. The Amor wavelet is a reliable and precise choice for applications.

These problems include deducing the unknown properties of biological structures or tissues from the observed imaging data, presenting a unique challenge in decoding intricate biological phenomena. Regarding disease detection, this technique has played a critical role in optimizing diagnostic efficiency by extracting meaningful insights from different imaging modalities like molecular imaging, MRI, and CT scans. Inverse problems contribute to uncovering subtle abnormalities by employing iterative optimization techniques and sophisticated algorithms, enabling precise and early disease detection. Deep learning (DL) solutions have emerged as robust mechanisms for addressing inverse problems in biomedical image analysis, especially in disease recognition. Inverse problems involve reconstructing unknown structures or parameters from observed data, and the DL model excels in learning complex representations and mappings. This study develops a DL Solution for Inverse Problems in the Advanced Biomedical Image Analysis on Disease Detection (DLSIP-ABIADD) technique. The DLSIP-ABIADD technique exploits the DL approach to solve inverse problems and detect the presence of diseases on biomedical images. To solve the inverse problem, the DLSIP-ABIADD technique uses a direct mapping approach. Bilateral filtering (BF) is used for image preprocessing. Besides, the MobileNetv2 model derives feature vectors from the input images. Moreover, the Henry gas solubility optimization (HGSO) method is applied for optimal hyperparameter selection of the MobileNetv2 model. Furthermore, a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) model is deployed to identify diseases in medical images. Extensive simulations have been involved to illustrate the better performance of the DLSIP-ABIADD technique. The experimentation outcomes stated that the DLSIP-ABIADD technique performs better than other models. © The Author(s) 2024.","Biomedical image analysis; Deep learning; Disease detection; Henry gas solubility optimization; Image preprocessing","Algorithms; Deep Learning; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; algorithm; computer assisted diagnosis; deep learning; human; image processing; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; procedures; x-ray computed tomography","","","","","Future University in Egypt, FUE; King Saud University, KSU; Deanship of Scientific Research, King Khalid University, (RGP2/87/45); Deanship of Scientific Research, King Khalid University; Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University, IAU, (PNURSP2024R507); Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University, IAU; Deanship of Scientific Research, Princess Nourah Bint Abdulrahman University, DSR, (RSPD2024R608); Deanship of Scientific Research, Princess Nourah Bint Abdulrahman University, DSR; Deanship of Scientific Research, Imam Mohammed Ibn Saud Islamic University, (NBU-FFR-2024- 2903-07); Deanship of Scientific Research, Imam Mohammed Ibn Saud Islamic University","The authors extend their appreciation to the Deanship of Research and Graduate Studies at King Khalid University for funding this work through Large Research Project under grant number RGP2/87/45.

This assessment is still manually performed by trained specialists, who may be a bottleneck within the clinical process. Deep learning algorithms are a promising approach to automate this bone marrow cell evaluation. These artificial intelligence models have focused on limited cell subtypes, mainly associated to a particular disease, and are frequently presented as black boxes. The herein introduced strategy presents an engineered feature representation, the region-attention embedding, which improves the deep learning classification performance of a cytomorphology with 21 bone marrow cell subtypes. This embedding is built upon a specific organization of cytology features within a squared matrix by distributing them after pre-segmented cell regions, i.e., cytoplasm, nucleus, and whole-cell. This novel cell image representation, aimed to preserve spatial/regional relations, is used as input of the network. Combination of region-attention embedding and deep learning networks (Xception and ResNet50) provides local relevance associated to image regions, adding up interpretable information to the prediction. Additionally, this approach is evaluated in a public database with the largest number of cell subtypes (21) by a thorough evaluation scheme with three iterations of a 3-fold cross-validation, performed in 80% of the images (n = 89,484), and a testing process in an unseen set of images composed by the remaining 20% of the images (n = 22,371). This evaluation process demonstrates the introduced strategy outperforms previously published approaches in an equivalent validation set, with a f1-score of 0.82, and presented competitive results on the unseen data partition with a f1-score of 0.56. © 2024 The Authors","Biomedical image processing; Bone marrow cell subtypes; Cytomorphology; Deep learning; Interpretability","","","","","","MinCiencias","This work was supported in part by the project with code 110192092354 and entitle \u201CProgram for the Early Detection of Premalignant Lesions and Gastric Cancer in urban, rural and dispersed areas in the Department of Nari\u00F1o\u201D of call No. 920 of 2022 of MinCiencias.","Thachil J., Bates I., Approach to the Diagnosis and Classification of Blood Cell Disorders, (2017); Ladines-Castro W., Barragan-Ibanez G., Luna-Perez M., Et al., Morphology of leukaemias, Revista Médica del Hospital General de México, 79, 2, pp. 107-113, (2016); Wu Q., Zeng L., Ke H., Xie W., Zheng H., Zhang Y., Analysis of blood and bone marrow smears using multispectral imaging analysis techniques, Medical Imaging 2005: Image Processing, 5747, pp. 1872-1882, (2005); Tomasian A., Jennings J.W., Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy: techniques and practice implications, Skeletal Radiol, 51, 1, pp. 81-88, (2022); Malempati S., Joshi S., Lai S., Braner D.A., Tegtmeyer K., Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, N Engl J Med, 361, 15, (2009); Gilotra M., Gupta M., Singh S., Sen R., Comparison of bone marrow aspiration cytology with bone marrow trephine biopsy histopathology: an observational study, J Lab Physicians, 9, 3, pp. 182-189, (2017); Tuchin V., Tissue Optics: Light Scattering Methods and Instruments for Medical Diagnostics, (2015); Ortega S., Halicek M., Fabelo H., Callico G.M., Fei B., Hyperspectral and multispectral imaging in digital and computational pathology: a systematic review, Biomed Optics Express, 11, 6, pp. 3195-3233, (2020); Lantos C., Kornblau S.M., Qutub A.A., Quantitative-morphological and cytological analyses in leukemia, Hematology: Latest Research and Clinical Advances, pp. 95-113, (2018); Mohd S., Md M., Wan W., White blood cell (WBC) counting analysis in blood smear images using various color segmentation methods, Measure J Int Measure Confederat, 116, pp. 543-555, (2018); Alqudah A., Al-Ta'ani O., Al-Badarneh A., Automatic segmentation and classification of white blood cells in peripheral blood samples, J Eng Sci Technol Rev, 11, 6, pp. 7-13, (2018); Salahuddin Z., Woodruff H.C., Chatterjee A., Lambin P., Transparency of deep neural networks for medical image analysis: a review of interpretability methods, Comput Biol Med, 140, (2022); Rawat J., Singh A., B.

The effects of either eggshell membrane (ESM) and green seaweed (Ulva lactuca) extracts alone or in combination were evaluated for in vivo skin wound healing in a rat model of induced diabetes. Methods: Micronized powders of waste hen ESM, Ulva lactuca, and their 1:1 mixture were prepared using regular procedures. The mechanical, electrical, and surface morphology characteristics of powders were examined using direct compression, LCR-impedancemetry, and scanning electron microscopy. The effect of ESM, Ulva lactuca, and their mixture as compared to standard Dermazin treatments were evaluated on wounds inflicted on male Wistar Albino rats with induced diabetes. Quantitative wound healing rates at baseline and at 3, 7, 14, and 21 days of treatments among all rat groups were conducted using ANOVA. Qualitative histological analysis of epidermal re-epithelization, keratinocytes, basement membrane, infiltrating lymphocytes, collagen fibrines, and blood vessels at day 21 were performed using Image J processing program. Results: Compressive strength measurements of tablets showed a Young’s modulus of 44.14 and 27.17 MPa for the ESM and ESM + Ulva lactuca mixture, respectively. Moreover, both samples exhibited relatively low relative permittivity values of 6.62 and 6.95 at 1 MHz, respectively, due to the porous surface morphology of ESM shown by scanning electron microscopy. On day 21, rats treated with ESM had a complete diabetic wound closure, hair regrowth, and a healing rate of 99.49%, compared to 96.79% for Dermazin, 87.05% for Ulva lactuca, 90.23% for the mixture, and only 36.44% for the negative controls. A well-formed basement membrane, well-differentiated epithelial cells, and regular thick keratinocytes lining the surface of the epidermal cells accompanied wound healing in rats treated with ESM, which was significantly better than in control rats. Conclusion: Ground hen ESM powder, a low-cost effective biomaterial, is better than Ulva lactuca or their mixture for preventing tissue damage and promoting diabetic wound healing, in addition to various biomedical applications. © The Author(s) 2024.","Compressive strength; Dielectric constant; Eggshell membrane (ESM); Induced-diabetes wound; Seaweed (Ulva lactuca); Wound healing","algal extract; antidiabetic agent; sulfadiazine silver; Ulva lactuca extract; unclassified drug; animal experiment; animal model; Article; cell differentiation; comparative study; compressive strength; controlled study; diabetic wound; eggshell membrane; epidermis cell; epithelium cell; hair growth; in vivo study; keratinocyte; male; nonhuman; porosity; powder; rat; rat model; skin injury; surface property; Ulva lactuca; wound healing; Young modulus","","sulfadiazine silver, 22199-08-2","","","","","Abouzid M.R., Ali K., Elkhawas I., Elshafei S.M., An overview of diabetes mellitus in Egypt and the significance of integrating preventive cardiology in diabetes management, Cureus, 14, 7, (2022); Whiting D.R., Guariguata L., Weil C., Shaw J., IDF Diabetes atlas: global estimates of the prevalence of diabetes for 2011 and 2030, Diab Res Clin Prac, 94, 3, pp. 311-321, (2011); Hegazi R., El-Gamal M., Abdel-Hady N., Hamdy O., Epidemiology of and risk factors for type 2 diabetes in Egypt, Ann Glob Health, 81, 6, pp. 814-820, (2015); Gurtner G.C., Chapman M.A., Regenerative medicine: charting a new course in wound healing, Adv Wound Care, 5, 7, pp. 314-328, (2016); Deng L., Du C., Song P., Chen T., Rui S., Et al., The role of oxidative stress and antioxidants in diabetic wound healing, Oxi Med Cell Longev, 2021, (2021); Troy E., Tilbury M.A., Power A.M., Wall J.G., Nature-based biomaterials and their application in biomedicine, Polym, 13, 19, (2021); Rajendran S.B., Challen K., Wright K.L., Hardy J.G., Electrical stimulation to enhance wound healing, J Fun Biomater, 12, 2, (2021); Korelo R.I., Kryczyk M., Garcia C., Naliwaiko K., Fernandes L.C., Wound healing treatment by high frequency ultrasound, microcurrent, and combined therapy modifies the immune response in rats, Braz J Phys Ther, 20, 2, pp. 133-141, (2016); Marston W., Tang J., Kirsner R.S., Ennis W., Repair Soc., 24, 1, pp. 136-144, (2016); Kanji S., Das H., Advances of stem cell therapeutics in cutaneous wound healing and regeneration, Mediat Inflam, 2017, (2017); Pulido-Escribano V., Torrecillas-Baena B., Dorado G., Galvez-Moreno M.A., Camacho-Cardenosa M., Et al., Combination of biomaterials and extracellular vesicles from mesenchymal stem-cells: new therapeutic strategies for skin-wound healing, App Sci, 13, 4, (2023); Liu M., Luo G., Wang Y., Xu R., Wang Y., Et al., Nano-silver-decorated microfibrous eggshell membrane: processing, cytotoxicity assessment and optimization, antibacterial activity and wound healing, Sci Rep, 7, 1, (2017); Shi Y., Zhou K., Li D., Guyonnet V., Hincke M.T., Et al., Avian eggshell membrane as a novel biomaterial: a review, Foods (Basel Switzerland), 10, 9, (2021); Mendoza N., Chavez G., Araya O., Eggshell membrane treatment for the healing of superficial open wounds in mice.
